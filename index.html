          Who we are
        </h2>
          <p>
             Here at TDTC, we are attempting to develop simplistic computerized devices your canine can operate. Is it crazy? Maybe. But here we like to think that the first people to utilize pidgeons as message carriers, or dogs to pull sleds, were thought to be crazy as well. Our aim is focused on service-animal solutions, but we hope to one day bring specialized touchscreens, devices powered by adaptive accelerometers just like the ones in your iPhone that react to shaking and tilting, and all sorts of other devices a dog can use to communicate with their owners, find their way home if they get lost, open and close certain doors, and new ways to play, all of which will only help teach your dog things about the world around it that no dog has ever learned before!
           </p>

         <p>
           We're willing to bet it doesn't sound quite so crazy to you any more! If you would like to donate to our cause, just <a href="donate.html">follow the links!</a>
