            Rusty, a four year old German Shepard from Portland, Oregon studied
            web design, learning html and CSS. After only one week, Rusty learned
            how to tap his paw repeatedly on the keyboard to get a treat as a
            reward.
          </p>
          <p>
            Week two Rusty moved into more advanced techniques. However, Rusty
            expressed frusturation and chewed the keyboard.
